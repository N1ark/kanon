Names that Lean reads as keywords are quoted in the Lean files, in a position
where Lean reads the quotes: a name that follows a prefix is not quoted, as
`r_«at»` is the name `r_` and then `«at»`.

A rule named after a keyword has the rule function `r_at`, with the arms and
the soundness theorems of its name:

  $ cat > lang.knl <<'KN'
  > use "rules"
  > sort TInt
  > node Int of int : TInt
  > notation Int
  > node Neg : TInt -> TInt
  > KN
  $ cat > rules.kn <<'KN'
  > rule neg : Neg v =
  >   | at: Neg x -> x
  > KN
  $ kanon lean-all out lang.knl
  $ grep -rhoE 'Rules\.neg\.r_[^ .]*' out | sort -u
  Rules.neg.r_at
  Rules.neg.r_default
